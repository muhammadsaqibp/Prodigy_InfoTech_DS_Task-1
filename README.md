Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset focusing on visualizing the distribution of population data by gender over the years 2001 to 2022.

Dataset
The dataset utilized for this task contains records of the total, female, and male populations from 2001 to 2022.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language used for analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involved the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Ensured data quality by checking for and handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Transformation: Extracted relevant data for total, female, and male populations over the specified years.

Visualization:

Grouped Bar Chart: Compared total, female, and male populations annually.
Stacked Bar Chart: Illustrated the contribution of male and female populations to the total population each year.
Difference Bar Chart: Highlighted the annual differences between male and female populations.
Top 10 Countries Bar Chart: Displayed the top 10 countries by total population in 2022, along with their male and female populations.
Conclusion
Through this analysis, we observed consistent growth in the total population from 2001 to 2022, with male and female populations maintaining a relatively balanced distribution. The visualizations effectively highlight demographic trends and provide insights into gender distribution over time.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
